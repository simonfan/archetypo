# archetypo[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/simonfan/archetypo.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/simonfan/archetypo)

RequireJS based invocation parser.

Heavily inspired (if not a copy of) by AngularJS directives.



The central idea of archetypo.js is to allow AMD module loading and invocation through the
html markup rather than let the instantiation to be done via JS.


Javascript module files should define classes that need to be instantiated.


Class definition logic should be separate from Object instantiation logic.
